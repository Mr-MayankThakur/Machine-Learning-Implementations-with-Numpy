Getting started
---------------
Execute these steps from an Anaconda prompt to get started with this project::

    conda env create -f environment.yml -n machine_learning_implementations_with_numpy
    conda activate machine_learning_implementations_with_numpy

Running the project
-------------------
You can run the project using the following steps::

    python machine_learning_implementations_with_numpy.py

The script will print the help for a set of supported commands. The project has the following commands available:

* :code:`prepare` Prepares the dataset
* :code:`train` Trains the model
* :code:`serve` Serves the trained model

This project is based on the `cookiecutter-machinelearning`_ template
